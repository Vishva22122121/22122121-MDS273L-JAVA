This Java program is a menu-driven application that allows users to perform various operations on an array of names. The available options include adding a name, searching for a name, removing a name, displaying all names, and quitting the program.
To store the names entered by the user, the programme first creates an array named Name with a capacity of 1024. To manage the programme loop, the boolean variable flag is initially set to false. To keep track of how many names are added to the array, an integer variable named i is initialised to zero.
Until the user decides to end the programme, the do-while loop continues to execute. System.out.println commands are used inside the loop to display a menu. The nextLine function of the Scanner class is used to determine the user's selection, and the Integer.parseInt method is used to convert the input to an integer. Depending on the user's selection, a switch statement is used to execute the proper code block.
The programme prompts the user to input a name and determines whether it already exists in the Name array if the user selects option 1. The name is added to the array at the ith position, and i is increased, if it is not already there. Otherwise, the programme shows a notice to the user.
If the user selects option 2, the programme asks them to enter a name to search for before utilising a for loop to look up the name in the Name array. The programme shows the position of the name in the array if it is found; else, it displays a message to show that the name was not found.
If the user selects option 3, the programme asks them to enter a name to remove before utilising a for loop to look up the name in the Name array. If the name is detected, the programme deletes it by moving all items one position to the left following the name's position.
If the user selects option 4, all names in the Name array that are not null are displayed.
If the user selects option 5, the programme changes the flag variable's value from true to false and ends the loop.
In general, the program's menu-driven user interface enables users to manage lists of names. There are certain problems with the implementation, though, such as the failure to handle situations where the user submits erroneous data or when the array capacity is exceeded. Furthermore, the programme is unable to handle the situation in which a user tries to remove a name that is not listed in the array.
